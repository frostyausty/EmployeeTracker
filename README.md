# EmployeeTracker

This command line application helps the user manage employees at a given company. 

## Description

I used MYSQL to create a database with an employee, role, and department table and populated them with data about the employees. I used the Inquirer package to create prompts asking the user for certain information depending on which action is selected. Upon running node server, the user is provided a number of options that either view current data or add new data. They can view the departments, all the roles, and departments, but can also add either one to the database as well.
